# Cerberus Common

This project contains files shared among Cerberus projects. All changes are happening inside the [Cerberus Firmware repository](https://github.com/Cerberus-Wallet/cerberus-firmware).

We also export this project to the [cerberus-common repository](https://github.com/Cerberus-Wallet/cerberus-common) as a read-only copy so third parties may depend on that instead of the whole monorepo. It is meant to be used as a submodule using:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/Cerberus-Wallet/cerberus-common.git cerberus-common
```
